## 🎯 Next Steps: Testing

### 1. Deploy Main Site
Deploy your updated code with the new header to your hosting platform.

### 2. Clear All Caches
```bash
# Netlify: Site Settings → Clear cache and deploy
# Browser: Ctrl+Shift+Delete → Clear cached images
```

### 3. Test Each Iframe
Follow the testing guide in `IFRAME_TEST_GUIDE.md`:
- Test contacts demo iframe
- Test pipeline demo iframe
- Test dashboard demo iframe (may take 30-60s on Replit)
- Test calendar demo iframe

### 4. Verify in DevTools
- Open F12 → Console
- Look for any X-Frame-Options errors
- Check Network tab for 200 OK responses
- Verify iframes load and are interactive

## 📋 Expected Results

### Success Indicators
- ✅ No "Refused to display" errors
- ✅ No X-Frame-Options console errors
- ✅ Iframes load within 2-5 seconds (Netlify) or 30-60s (Replit)
- ✅ Full interactivity within iframes (click, scroll, type)
- ✅ Loading spinners show while iframes load
- ✅ Retry buttons work if initial load fails

### What You'll See

#### Calendar Demo
- Calendar interface
- Date picker

- AI suggestions

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Iframe Shows "Refused to display"
1. Verify demo site is accessible directly
2. Check Response Headers in Network tab
3. Redeploy demo site with "Clear cache and deploy"
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for CDN to clear

### If Iframe Loads but Isn't Interactive
1. Check Console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify sandbox attribute includes `allow-same-origin allow-scripts`
3. Test in different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

### If Iframe Never Loads
1. Click "Open in New Tab" to verify demo works
2. Check if retry counter increases (1/3, 2/3, 3/3)
3. After 3 retries, use "Open in New Tab"
4. For Replit: Wait 60 seconds minimum

## 📊 Performance Notes

### Load Times by Demo Site

**Netlify Sites (Contacts, Pipeline, Calendar):**
- Cold start: 2-5 seconds
- Cached: < 1 second
- CDN: Global edge network

**Replit Site (Dashboard):**
- Cold start: 30-60 seconds
- Warm start: 2-5 seconds
- No CDN: Direct server connection

### Optimization Tips
1. Preload critical demos with `<link rel="preconnect">`
2. Consider warming Replit server before user visits
3. Add Service Worker for offline fallback
4. Implement iframe placeholder images
