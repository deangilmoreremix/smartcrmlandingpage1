   - Hosted on Netlify CDN
   - Load in 2-5 seconds
   - Always available
   - No wait time

2. **Dashboard Demo** (Replit)
   - Dynamic server
   - First load: 30-60 seconds
   - Warm load: 2-5 seconds
   - May sleep after inactivity

## Using the Dashboard Demo

### First Time Loading

When you click "View Live Demo" for the dashboard:

1. **Loading Screen Appears**
   - Shows spinning loader
   - Message: "Loading Dashboard Demo"
   - Estimated time: 30-60 seconds

2. **What's Happening Behind the Scenes**

3. **Be Patient!**
   - Don't refresh or close the demo
   - Wait the full 60 seconds if needed
   - The demo WILL load - just give it time

### If Demo Doesn't Load

You'll see helpful options:

#### Option 1: Wake Up Server
- Click the "Wake Up Server" button
- Watch the progress indicator (0-100%)
- Wait for "Server is now online!" message
- Demo will load automatically

#### Option 2: Wake & Open in New Tab

- Best option if iframe isn't loading

#### Option 3: Retry
- Click "Wake & Retry" to try again
- System will wake server and retry loading
- Works for most connection issues

### Understanding the Progress Indicator

When you see the circular progress indicator:
- **0-30%** - Sending wake-up request
- **30-60%** - Server initializing
- **60-90%** - Application starting
- **90-100%** - Final checks
- **100%** - Ready to open!

## Tips for Best Experience

### First Visit
1. Click "View Live Demo"
2. Be prepared to wait 30-60 seconds
3. Don't refresh the page during loading
4. If timeout occurs, use "Wake Up Server"

### Subsequent Visits (Within 1 Hour)
1. Demo should load in 2-5 seconds
2. Server is already warm
3. No wake-up needed

### After 1 Hour of Inactivity
1. Server goes back to sleep
2. Requires wake-up again
3. Will take 30-60 seconds again

## Troubleshooting

### "Server Taking Longer Than Expected"

**What it means:** Server is taking more than 60 seconds to wake up

**What to do:**
1. Click "Wake & Retry" - this often resolves it
2. Check your internet connection
3. Try "Wake & Open in Tab" instead
4. If all else fails, click "Reset & Try Again"

### "Connection Issue Detected"

**What it means:** Unable to connect to the demo server

**What to do:**
1. Use "Wake Up Server" button first
2. Wait for progress to complete (100%)
3. Then try loading demo again
4. If still failing, try direct link in new tab

### Demo Opens but Shows Error Page

**What it means:** Server is still waking up

**What to do:**
1. Wait 30 seconds on the error page
2. Refresh the browser tab
3. Server should be warm now
4. Demo will load successfully

**A:** No! Production Smart CRM uses enterprise hosting with:
- Sub-second load times
- 99.9% uptime
- No cold starts
- Global CDN
- Dedicated servers

### Q: Can I test the demo multiple times?
**A:** Absolutely! After the first load, the server stays warm for about 1 hour, making subsequent loads much faster.

### Q: What if I don't want to wait?
**A:** Use the other demos (Contacts, Pipeline, Calendar) which load instantly. They showcase the same AI-powered features in different modules.

### Q: Is my data saved in the demo?
**A:** No, demo data is temporary and resets regularly. Your real data in the production version is secure and persistent.
